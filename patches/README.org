Since I use =nixpkgs-unstable= (I am an Arch user (btw) at heart), there are some cases where certain packages will break or fail to build (usually due to my extremely customized, non-standard system).

With Nix, I /could/ just rollback everything and wait to update until an upstream patch fixes things, but if it's a quick fix, I'd rather just patch it in immediately so that everything else can stay up to date.

Patches end up in and out of this directory. Ideally, there shouldn't be any patches here!
