** What is this repository?
These are my dotfiles (configuration files) for my NixOS setup(s).

Here is my main setup:

** My Themes
[[https://github.com/danth/stylix#readme][Stylix]] (and [[https://github.com/SenchoPens/base16.nix#readme][base16.nix]], of course) is amazing, allowing you to theme your entire system with base16-themes.

Using this I have [[./themes][55+ themes]] (I add more sometimes) I can switch between on-the-fly. Visit the [[./themes][themes directory]] for more info and screenshots!

** Install
I wrote some reinstall notes for myself [[./install.org][here (install.org)]].

TLDR: You should™ be able to install my dotfiles to a fresh NixOS system with the following experimental script:
#+begin_src sh :noeval
nix-shell -p git --command "nix run --experimental-features 'nix-command flakes' gitlab:librephoenix/nixos-config"
#+end_src

Disclaimer: Ultimately, I can't gaurantee this will work for anyone other than myself, so /use this at your own discretion/. Also my dotfiles are /highly/ opinionated, which you will discover immediately if you try them out.

Potential Errors: I've only tested it working on UEFI with the default EFI mount point of =/boot=. I've added experimental legacy (BIOS) boot support, but it does rely on a quick and dirty script to find the grub device. If you are testing it using some weird boot configuration for whatever reason, try modifying =bootMountPath= (UEFI) or =grubDevice= (legacy BIOS) in =flake.nix= before install, or else it will complain about not being able to install the bootloader.

Note: If you're installing this to a VM, Hyprland won't work unless 3D acceleration is enabled.

Security Disclaimer: If you install or copy my =homelab= or =worklab= profiles, /CHANGE THE PUBLIC SSH KEYS UNLESS YOU WANT ME TO BE ABLE TO SSH INTO YOUR SERVER. YOU CAN CHANGE OR REMOVE THE SSH KEY IN THE RELEVANT CONFIGURATION.NIX/:
- [[./profiles/homelab/configuration.nix][configuration.nix]] for homelab profile
- [[./profiles/worklab/configuration.nix][configuration.nix]] for worklab profile

** Modules
Separate Nix files can be imported as modules using an import block:
#+BEGIN_SRC nix
imports = [ ./import1.nix
            ./import2.nix
            ...
          ];
#+END_SRC

This conveniently allows configurations to be (*cough cough) /modular/ (ba dum, tssss).

I have my modules separated into two groups:
- System-level - stored in the [[./system][system directory]]
  - System-level modules are imported into configuration.nix, which is what is sourced into [[./flake.nix][my flake (flake.nix)]]
- User-level - stored in the [[./user][user directory]] (managed by home-manager)
  - User-level modules are imported into home.nix, which is also sourced into [[./flake.nix][my flake (flake.nix)]]

More detailed information on these specific modules are in the [[./system][system directory]] and [[./user][user directory]] respectively.

** Patches
In some cases, since I use =nixpgs-unstable=, I must patch nixpkgs. This can be done inside of a flake via:
#+BEGIN_SRC nix
    nixpkgs-patched = (import nixpkgs { inherit system; }).applyPatches {
      name = "nixpkgs-patched";
      src = nixpkgs;
      patches = [ ./example-patch.nix ];
    };

    # configure pkgs
    pkgs = import nixpkgs-patched { inherit system; };

    # configure lib
    lib = nixpkgs.lib;
#+END_SRC

Patches can either be local or remote, so you can even import unmerged pull requests by using =fetchpatch= and the raw patch url, i.e: https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/example.patch.

I currently curate patches local to this repo in the [[./patches][patches]] directory.

** Profiles
I separate my configurations into [[./profiles][profiles]] (essentially system templates), i.e:
- [[./profiles/personal][Personal]] - What I would run on a personal laptop/desktop
- [[./profiles/work][Work]] - What I would run on a work laptop/desktop (if they let me bring my own OS :P)
- [[./profiles/homelab][Homelab]] - What I would run on a server or homelab
- [[./profiles/wsl][WSL]] - What I would run underneath Windows Subystem for Linux

My profile can be conveniently selected in [[./flake.nix][my flake.nix]] by setting the =profile= variable.

More detailed information on these profiles is in the [[./profiles][profiles directory]].

** Nix Wrapper Script
Some Nix commands are confusing, really long to type out, or require me to be in the directory with my dotfiles. To solve this, I wrote a [[./system/bin/phoenix.nix][wrapper script called phoenix]], which calls various scripts in the root of this directory.

TLDR:
- =phoenix sync= - Synchronize system and home-manager state with config files (essentially =nixos-rebuild switch= + =home-manager switch=)
  - =phoenix sync system= - Only synchronize system state (essentially =nixos-rebuild switch=)
  - =phoenix sync user= - Only synchronize home-manager state (essentially =home-manager switch=)
- =phoenix update= - Update all flake inputs without synchronizing system and home-manager states
- =phoenix upgrade= - Update flake.lock and synchronize system and home-manager states (=phoenix update= + =phoenix sync=)
- =phoenix refresh= - Call synchronization posthooks (mainly to refresh stylix and some dependent daemons)
- =phoenix pull= - Pull changes from upstream git and attempt to merge local changes (I use this to update systems other than my main system)
- =phoenix harden= - Ensure that all "system-level" files cannot be edited by an unprivileged user
- =phoenix soften= - Relax permissions so all dotfiles can be edited by a normal user (use temporarily for git or other operations)
- =phoenix gc= - Garbage collect the system and user nix stores
  - =phoenix gc full= - Delete everything not currently in use
  - =phoenix gc 15d= - Delete everything older than 15 days
  - =phoenix gc 30d= - Delete everything older than 30 days
  - =phoenix gc Xd= - Delete everything older than X days

** Star History
Didn't think this would get that many [[https://star-history.com/#librephoenix/nixos-config&Date][stars on GitHub]], yet here we are:
